181,Do women pay less for life insurance?,"No. Women historically paid less for policies because they have a longer life expectancy, but 
since the European Court of Justice gender directive was introduced in 2012 this gender-related fact 
can no longer be considered when it comes to calculating premiums."
182,What is the difference between life insurance and life assurance?,"The terms ‘insurance’ and ‘assurance’ are sometimes confused – life insurance is a more popular term. 
The term ‘assurance’ is the provision of cover for an event that will definitely happen but insurance 
is cover for an event that might happen."
183,Do I need a personal life insurance policy if I have group coverage through work?,"Group policies are a great benefit for employees but are generally only in force while you are 
employed with that company. So, if you leave the company or retire, you may be without coverage. 
Therefore, a personal life policy assures adequate coverage regardless of your employment and may 
provide coverage after retirement when you are older, which often means significantly higher premiums."
184,Do I need life insurance if I’m single and have no family depending on me?,"Quite possibly. While you may not have a spouse or family depending on your income to get through life, 
you may have debts and final expenses that someone will be responsible for. Also, if you are a younger 
single person, you have the advantage of being more insurable and, therefore, can get much better rates 
or take advantage of a Endowment with whole life policy which can build significant cash value over the years."
185,Can I change my insurance policy once I purchase it?,"Specially, Sum Assured and term cannot change after the policy issued. But as per demand of Assured 
nominee can change any time before the policy ends, other things like, address, phone number, mode 
of payment etc. can also be changed."
186,What Is the Underwriting Process?,"The underwriting process is a method through which carriers assess your risk based on the 
medical exam (if needed), answers on the proposal form and relating to income source for 
payout premium to conclude whether or not to approve, deny, postpone or rate up a life insurance policy."
187,What is bonus?,"The additional sum that the policyholder will get during the term of the insurance plan or 
at maturity of the plan, provided he/she has paid all premium amounts due for a specified minimum 
number of years. Bonus is the amount added to the basic sum assured under a with-profit life insurance policy."

190,What is Money Back Insurance?,"Money back plans mean that money is returned to the life insured as a survival benefit after a set period. When the policyholder survives the policy term, the money back is guaranteed. In the event of the policyholder's death, the nominee receives the amount guaranteed as well as any accumulated bonuses, if any."
191,What is a Rider?,"A rider is an insurance policy provision that adds benefits to or amends the terms of a basic insurance policy. Riders provide insured parties with additional coverage options, or they may even restrict or limit coverage. There is an additional cost if a party decides to purchase a rider.
